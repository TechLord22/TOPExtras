TOP Extras is an addon mod for [The One Probe](https://github.com/McJtyMods/TheOneProbe) which adds many new providers, aiming to provide feature-parity with [Hwyla](https://github.com/TehNut-Mods/HWYLA) and [WAWLA](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/WAWLA). 

It additionally provides info providers for (previously) Hwyla-only mods, such as [Dynamic Trees](https://github.com/DynamicTreesTeam/DynamicTrees) or [Apotheosis](https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/Apotheosis/).

Feel free to make suggestions for more providers!
